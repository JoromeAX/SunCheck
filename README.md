# SunCheck

Excited to share my latest project — SunCheck, a weather app built to deliver real-time weather updates with offline support, localization, and interactive UI elements. This project was designed to showcase both user-centric interface design and seamless data handling for offline accessibility.

Key Features:

    •    Real-time weather updates based on location or city search
    •    Offline access with data caching for uninterrupted use
    •    Clean, user-friendly design inspired by iOS weather app standards

Technologies Used:

    •    SwiftUI: For building a responsive, intuitive interface
    •    CoreData: To cache weather data for offline access
    •    Alamofire: To manage network requests and parsing
    •    OpenWeather API: Real-time data for dynamic weather info
    •    Combine: For managing asynchronous updates smoothly
    •    Location Services: Auto-detection of user’s location
    •    Notification Center: Instant updates for weather changes

Why SunCheck?
This app challenged me to blend essential mobile development skills, from networking to data management, into one cohesive experience. With SunCheck, I aimed to develop an app that’s both useful in daily life and showcases my technical strengths in iOS development.
